# Deep Learning Model for Image Classification

This project uses a deep learning model built with Keras and TensorFlow to classify images from the **MNIST** dataset.

## Overview

The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) for training and 10,000 images for testing. This model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve high accuracy in classifying the images.

### Key Features:
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Dataset**: MNIST handwritten digit dataset
- **Model Architecture**: CNN with multiple convolutional layers
- **Training**: 5 epochs

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for plotting graphs and displaying images)

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Model

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-repo
```

3. Run the training script:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### Model Training Output
```
Epoch 1/5
1875/1875 [==============================] - 50s 26ms/step - loss: 0.1492 - accuracy: 0.9531
...
Test accuracy: 0.9875
```

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of the following layers:
1. **Convolutional Layer**: Applies a 3x3 filter and uses ReLU activation.
2. **MaxPooling Layer**: Reduces the dimensionality of the image.
3. **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D output to a 1D vector.
4. **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer with ReLU activation.
5. **Output Layer**: A softmax layer with 10 units (for the 10 digit classes).

## Results

After training for 5 epochs, the model achieves a test accuracy of **98.75%**.
