# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts the stock prices of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The historical stock data is fetched from Yahoo Finance, and predictions are made based on past stock prices.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to use an LSTM model to predict future stock prices based on past stock data. LSTM networks are well-suited for time-series forecasting because they can learn from previous time steps to improve predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of historical stock price data of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) from Yahoo Finance, from **January 1, 2010** to **December 31, 2021**. The data includes the following features:

- Open price
- High price
- Low price
- Close price
- Volume

For this project, only the **Close** prices are used to predict future prices.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model is structured as follows:

- Input: A sequence of stock prices from the past 10 days.
- LSTM layer with 50 units and ReLU activation.
- Dense output layer with 1 unit, representing the predicted stock price.

The model uses the **Adam optimizer** and **mean squared error (MSE)** as the loss function.

## Installation

To run the project, you'll need to install the required dependencies:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-lstm.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```

## Usage

To run the stock price prediction, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python stock_price_prediction.py
   ```

The script will:
- Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Preprocess the data (normalize, create sequences, etc.).
- Train an LSTM model on the training data.
- Predict stock prices on the test data.
- Plot the actual and predicted stock prices.

## Results

The model outputs the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** between the actual and predicted stock prices and visualizes the prediction results.
